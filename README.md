5/27: populating with 'x' trajectories now succesful. still working on deleting all objects function to reset data. then will move on to recreating the 
object structure.

5/28: filter and user objects defined. routers set for trajectories in new structure using separate route and controller folders. populating and deleting trajectory data still functional. 

5/31: user object routes and controllers set, index page updated to use those routes. attempted to add extra API queries, also attempted to have router automatically set routers to newly added endpoints.
